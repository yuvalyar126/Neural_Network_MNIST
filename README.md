# Project: Machine Learning - Neural Network Optimization

# Description
This project focuses on developing and optimizing a fully connected feed-forward neural network for classifying handwritten digits. The goal is to find the best network architecture by experimenting with different configurations, such as layers, neurons, learning rates, and batch sizes.

# Components
**Preliminary Experiment (Simple_network_Experiment.ipynb):**

A basic neural network implementation to understand the fundamental principles of neural networks. This file serves as an initial experiment to guide further development.

**Neural Network Optimization (Neural_Network.ipynb):**

The main file of the project. Implements a generic neural network class and explores various architectures to find the optimal network configuration for digit classification.

**Draw Network (Draw_Network.ipynb):**

A tool that allows users to draw a digit on the screen, which is then classified by the trained neural network.

**Project Report (__למידת מכונה - פרויקט_.pdf):**

A detailed report documenting the project's process, experiments, and results analysis.
